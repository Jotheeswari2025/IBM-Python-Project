# IBM-Python-Project
    Analyzing Stock Performance, in this project I worked as a role of Data Analyst for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks.
    I have extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. 
    The stocks I worked on Tesla, Amazon, Gamestop, AMD
